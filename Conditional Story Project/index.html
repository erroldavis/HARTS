    <h1>Conditional Story Assignment</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this assignment, you will create a short story using code—specifically
        <strong>conditional statements</strong>. Using <strong>comparison operators</strong>,
        <strong>logical operators</strong>, and <strong>if / else</strong> statements, you will
        build a story about a player escaping a castle. Your story should change based on
        the conditions you test.
    </p>

    <h2>Set Up</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new folder to store this assignment.</li>
        <li>Inside that folder, create a JavaScript file named: <code>conditionalStory.js</code></li>
        <li>Create an <code>index.html</code> file.</li>
        <li>
            Add the HTML template code (type <code>!</code> then press Enter, or use <code>html:5</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
            Change the title to <strong>Conditional Story</strong> and connect your JavaScript file
            using a script tag: <code>&lt;script src="conditionalStory.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>JavaScript Code</h2>
    <p>
        Copy and paste the template below into <code>conditionalStory.js</code>, then follow along.
        After completing it, return and complete the submission step.
    </p>

    <pre><code>/*
INTRO
Underneath this comment create an alert method to define the start of the story.
Explain how our player ended up stuck in the castle.
Limit this intro to 1 or 2 sentences.
*/

/*PLAYER CLASS
Define a variable to represent the player's fighting class.
For example: warrior, sorcerer, healer, etc.

Then create a conditional statement that tests at least 2 different classes.
(Minimum: 1 else if statement)

Based on the character's class, use alert methods to define a unique weapon.
Finally, create an else statement to define a default weapon.
*/

/*PLAYER ABILITY
Define a variable to represent a unique player ability.
For example: fireball, healing spell, wind blast, etc.

Then create a conditional statement with at least 3 conditions that test
the player's class AND ability.
(Minimum: 2 else if statements)

Based on the character's class and ability, use alert methods to explain
how they'll defeat their enemy.

Finally, create an else statement to define a default method.
*/

/*THE BOSS FIGHT
Define a variable to represent the boss enemy.
For example: fire-breathing dragon, water monster, living tree, etc.

Then create a conditional statement with at least 3 conditions that test
the player's class, ability, and the boss.
(Minimum: 2 else if statements)

Based on the class, ability, and boss, use alert methods to explain
how the fight goes and whether the player wins or loses.

Finally, create an else statement to define a default boss.
*/

/*
PLAY AROUND
Try changing the values of the player's class, ability, and boss.
How does changing one variable change the story?
